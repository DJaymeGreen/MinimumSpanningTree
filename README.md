# MinimumSpanningTree

This Java project looks at the different ways to implement a Minimum Spanning Tree mainly looking into Kruskal and Prim's algorithm.

The main function is in MST.java with assumption of being run in an Linux/OSX environment; Windows environment can also run this, but a line of noted code has to be commented/un-commented from MST.java (it is noted in the main method). The file input is described in the Software Requirements Specifications in SRS.pdf. 

Also in this respository is a MST.pdf. This contains a written report about the exploration of what implementation is best for a minimum spanning tree based on different volume and density of data.
